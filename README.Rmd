The goal of tsdrtools is to make it easier for R users of TSD to install packages that fail install using the TSD mini-CRAN. 
Certain R-packages require compilation outside of TSD before they can be installed, and as such can be burdensome for some users to administer.
While the package is developed with the offline TSD server in mind, this package should also likely aid others needing to install packages on other offline servers. 

Since packages often have a myriad of dependencies, this process can becomes increasingly cumbersome, as all these extra packages also need to be obtained, which again might require special compilation. 

In the two step procedure here, a package is downloaded together with all dependent packages, zipped into an archive for easy import into TSD, where it can be unzipped and installed using a special function.

## Installation

You can install the development version of tsdrtools 
```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install tsdrtools in R:
install.packages('tsdrtools', 
                 repos = c('https://lcbc-uio.r-universe.dev',
                           'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

for installation of this package inside TSD, download the newest source file from
[https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/tsdrtools/](https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/tsdrtools/).

Transfer the package to TSD (import it), and install as a source package.
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("/path/to/tsdrtools.tar.gz", repo = NULL)
```


## Example

This package contains two main functions:

1. `tsd_package_prepare()` is used outside of TSD, with internet connection to prepare a package for install within TSD.  
2. Once step 1 is completed and data transferred to TSD, the `tsd_package_install()` is used within TSD to install the package within TSD.  

```{r prepare-package, eval = FALSE}
library(tsdrtools)

# outside TSD
tsd_package_prepare("dplyr")

# within TSD
tsd_package_install("dplyr.zip")
```

## Limitations
Currently the package will only install packages that are available on CRAN. 
We are working on a version that might allow downloading and making available packages from other repositories, but that is more difficult.
